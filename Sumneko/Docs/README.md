#Autofill Files
This folder is full of [u]definition files[/u]. None of these lua files will actually run. Their purpose is to suggest code snippets when using [sumneko's lua extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua).

If autofill is not working correctly, please download the extension and reload VS Code.
